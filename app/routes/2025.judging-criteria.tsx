              Certain <Highlight>major mistakes</Highlight> result in an

              <styled.li>
                <Highlight>Going Off Track</Highlight>: If the car leaves the

              <styled.li>
                <Highlight>Mechanical Failure or Stoppage</Highlight>: If a car

              allow the drivers to restart the run. However, if the lead and

              continue, and any errors or incidents will be judged as part of
              the battle. The restart line ensures that both drivers have a fair

            <P>
              In the event that two drivers receive identical scores or a battle
              is too close to call,{" "}
              <Highlight>tie-breaking procedures</Highlight> come into play to
              ensure a decisive result:
            </P>

            <H3>One More Time (OMT) Runs</H3>
            <P>
              If judges cannot determine a winner in a tandem battle (or if two
              qualifying scores are exactly even and a rank must be decided), a{" "}
              <Highlight>rematch</Highlight> can be called. Judges will announce
              a <Highlight>One More Time</Highlight> when a battle is
              essentially a draw. The drivers will run the track again in a new
              set of runs to give judges another chance to pick a winner.
              RCDrift.uk follows the common practice of limiting repeated OMT
              calls to keep the tournament moving â€“ up to{" "}
              <Highlight>2 One-More-Time rematches</Highlight> can be called for
              a pair of drivers. After <Highlight>two OMTs</Highlight> (which
              would mean the drivers have run up to three sets of battles
              total), the judges must make a final decision on the winner, no
              matter how close. This rule ensures an endless loop of ties is
              avoided while still giving multiple chances to prove a clear
              victor. Judges are encouraged to use OMT{" "}
              <Highlight>sparingly</Highlight> and only when truly necessary.
            </P>

            <H3>Qualifying Ties</H3>
            <P>
              In qualifying, if drivers end up with the exact same total score
              (and tie-breakers like highest <Highlight>Line score</Highlight>{" "}
              or <Highlight>Style score</Highlight> still don't separate them),
              the organizers will use a <Highlight>sudden-death run</Highlight>{" "}
              to break the tie. Typically, this means each tied driver may be
              asked to do one more qualifying run (under the same criteria) to
              earn a new score. Alternatively, RCDrift.uk may arrange a{" "}
              <Highlight>head-to-head "tie-breaker battle"</Highlight> between
              the tied drivers if time permits, even though it's outside the
              normal bracket, to determine who ranks higher. This head-to-head
              approach is a last resort, used to ensure the qualifying order is
              clear before the tournament battles begin. The goal is to always
              have a <Highlight>distinct ranking</Highlight> so that brackets
              and matchups can be assigned without confusion.
